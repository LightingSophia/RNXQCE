# RNXQCE
RNXQCE is a comprehensive toolkit for solving many problems when preprocessing GNSS data. As we all know, TEQC stopped updated after 2019-02-25. Thus I make this software. It can check quality for both RINEX 2 and RINEX 3. If you have any problems or suggestions when using it, please get in touch with me. My email address is 2016301610237@whu.edu.cn
